## Part I: Catalog data exploration and prepration

If you have run the installation, you should have a directory called `macss/data` off you your home directory.  It contains some data we will be using.

Open the notebook `nb/Project_Part1.ipynb` to find a notebook you can work on this first part of the project in.


If you want to see what things should look like, you can have a look in:

1. in the notebook [00_ExploreFluxes.ipynb](https://github.com/KIPAC/MACSS/blob/main/nb/00_ExploreFluxes.ipynb) to see examples of magnitudes and colors.

2. in the notebook [03_LimitingMags.ipynb](https://github.com/KIPAC/MACSS/blob/main/nb/03_LimitingMags.ipynb) to see the effect of the cuts on the depth of the objects in the catalog.
